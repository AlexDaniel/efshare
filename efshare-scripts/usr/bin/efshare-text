# Usage:
# There are several ways to run this script:
#  ./thiscript yourcommand args...
#  yourcommand args... | ./thisscript
#  ./thisscript
# First one is preferred since it results in a meaningful filename
# Second variant uses $(date +%s) as a filename
# Last one shares your x primary selection, the first line of your primary
# selection is going to be used as a filename
